                <p>You will be writing a website to help manage a catering company. To accomplish this, you will need to consider three classes of users: the owner of the company, company staff, and registered customers. Customers will request events on given days (or cancel events they had previously requested), staff will sign up to work events, and the owner will given a rundown of what events are scheduled and who is working each event. The company cannot schedule more than 1 event per day, and each event needs only 3 Staff members to run.</p>
                <h2 id="specifications:">Specifications:</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>You must build your website using Python 3.6 or greater, Flask 0.12, SQLAlchemy, and the Flask-SQLAlchemy extension.</li>
                    <li>Managing users
                        <ul>
                            <li>Each user (Owner, Staff, or Customer) should have a username and password.</li>
                            <li>Customers are free to register for their own account.</li>
                            <li>Staff accounts must be created by the Owner (it is fine for the Owner to set passwords for the Staff).</li>
                            <li>If a user is logged in, no matter what page they are on, they should have access to a logout link.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Owner
                        <ul>
                            <li>Should be able to login with the username &#8220;owner&#8221; and password &#8220;pass&#8221;.</li>
                            <li>Once logged in, the Owner should be presented with a link to create new staff accounts, and a list of all scheduled events.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>For each event, the Staff members signed up to work that event should be listed.</li>
                                    <li>If no events are scheduled, a message should be displayed informing the Owner of this explicitly.</li>
                                    <li>If any scheduled event has no staff signed up to work, a message should be displayed informing the Owner of this explicitly.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>

                                    <li>No event that already has 3 Staff members signed up to work should be presented as a sign up option for other Staff members.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
